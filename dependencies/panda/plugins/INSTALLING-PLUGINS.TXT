HOW TO INSTALL MAX PANDA PLUGINS.

Step 1. Install the visual studio 2008 runtime by
running "vcredist_x86-sp1.exe" as administrator.
As a convenience, this installer is included with panda.

Step 2. Make sure that there is only one copy of panda
in your system PATH.  If you only have one copy of panda
installed, you can skip this step.

Step 3. Copy the relevant DLLs for your version
of max from the panda plugins directory to the
max plugins directory.  For instance, if you are 
using Max 9, copy maxegg9.dlo and maxeggimport9.dlo
