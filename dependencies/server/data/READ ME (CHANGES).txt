i'm gonna install a new system in the server.

Current X New

In current we have toon folder, in new is dropped.
In current, the doId follows the public CMU schema, in new they'll be attached
to the account.

Pros:
	Dropping 2 id-style
	Fixed doId per account/toon

Cons:
	Limits number of accounts to ~40000 (actually enough)

Day of the change: Unknown, but after I finish fishing stuff, so I'll work on friendship (again)
